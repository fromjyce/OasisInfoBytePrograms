# Web Development and Designing Intern at Oasis Infobyte
Delve into my GitHub repository, where I've compiled an assortment of projects developed during my engaging internship at Oasis Infobyte. These creations reflect my journey, from building foundational web elements like personal portfolios and interactive landing pages to crafting functional tools such as temperature converters and calculators using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Moving onward, my repertoire encompasses a tribute page and a practical to-do web app, showcasing a balance between aesthetics and usability. Venturing more profoundly, I tackled login authentication with Flask and delved into the full-stack territory, employing React, MongoDB, and Nodejs to construct a sophisticated Pizza Delivery Application. This culinary-themed project demonstrates technical prowess in user and admin authentication and includes dynamic features like pizza customization, secure payments via Razor Pay, inventory management, and admin-user interaction. These projects collectively narrate my progression from an intern to a capable web developer, highlighting proficiency and growth in a cohesive coding narrative.
